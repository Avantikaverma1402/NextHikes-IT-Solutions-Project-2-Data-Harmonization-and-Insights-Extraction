## NextHikes IT Solutions Project 2: Data Harmonization and Insights Extraction

**Problem Statement**
As a junior data scientist, your role is to address ambiguities and inconsistencies in multiple datasets. The goal is to leverage advanced data-wrangling techniques to produce a clean, unified dataset for future business analysis and modeling

**Dataset Overview**

Dataset_1: Contains attributes related to rentals and weather conditions.

Dataset_2: Provides additional rentals data for comprehensive analysis.

Dataset_3: Integrates with the other datasets to enhance insights.

**Attribute information:**
• date = date of the ride

• season - 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter

• holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday

• working day - whether the day is neither a weekend nor a holiday

• weather:- 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain +Scattered clouds 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog

• temp - "feels like" temperature in Celsius

• humidity - relative humidity

• windspeed - wind speed

• casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated

• registered - number of registered user rentals initiated

• count - number of total rentals

#### Tool & Techniques:

Tools (Libraries)- Pandas, Numpy, OpenPyXL , IPython.display, RandomForestRegressor, Matplotlib ,Seaborn

Techniques- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Merging and Joining, Handling Date/Time Data, Data Aggregation and Reduction, Visualization (for quick analysis)

#### *Project Phases*  

##### *1. Data Preparation*  
- Addressed missing values.  
- Conducted basic statistical analysis.

##### *2. Dataset Integration*  
- Merged datasets using common keys.  
- Detected and addressed outliers.

##### *3. Advanced Data Analysis*  
- Skewness analysis and correlation computations.  
- Visualized insights with boxplots and heatmaps.

#### Key Takeaways

**Environmental Effects:** Weather conditions significantly influence ride activity, with favorable conditions (warm, clear weather) promoting more rides.

**Temporal Dynamics:** Hourly and seasonal trends provide actionable insights for optimizing resource allocation (e.g., increasing bike availability during peak hours or seasons).

**Outlier Impacts:** Special events or extreme weather conditions could skew data, and handling them separately ensures better modeling accuracy.

**Predictive Potential:** Features like temperature, season, and weather can be key predictors for forecasting user counts.

#### Learning Outcomes

**Practical Experience in Data Handling-** 
Gained hands-on skills in dataset cleaning and wrangling techniques. Developed proficiency in managing missing values and outliers.
